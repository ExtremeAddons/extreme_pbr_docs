					"title": "BugFix - Error case with apply material" ,
					"description": "In some cases an error appeared when trying to apply a material or replace it, the error was minimal, as it could happen quite casually, this was because in some cases the k_size name selector, the one used to set the type of material, did not have any option selected, so it was null, this happened especially when a material without k_size variations was applied, so no button could be pressed, the material preview had to be changed and returned to it. Now this will not happen anymore as a function has been inserted in the operators that apply the material, which will check that the k_size is selected, otherwise it will be selected through this function"

					"title": "BugFix - Material not applied correctly in Blender 3.3" ,
					"description": "The material was applied with the Mix RGB node coming from the Blender 3.6 version, so it was an unknown node in Blender 3.3, the function that was responsible for replacing this node, was not working in the correct way, so it was fixed"

					"title": "Improved - Save Editor" ,
					"description": "It was chosen not to show the 'Save Editor' panel when the selected object had no material, or when no object was selected, this made things complicated if you just wanted to interact with the user libraries, so now the Save Editor panel will also be shown when those 2 cases occur"

					"title": "BugFix - Displacement button not show for materials saved as Nexus Modules" ,
					"description": "The displacement button was no longer present if a Nexus module had been saved with the appropriate 'SAVE MODULE' button in the 'SAVE EDITOR' panel, this because the saved material was not recognized as a Nexus material, so to solve the problem the function that shows the displacement button (Obviously if the Bump or Displacement texture is present) will search for Nexus modules, regardless of the type of Material."

Example: The applied material is Grass 001 version"

					"title": "Improved - Replace Material-Replace Module",
					"description": "Now if you try to replace a material in which textures are contained, for example at 1k with the same material at 2k (From the library) only the textures will be replaced, this to keep the parameters set by the user, so as not to have to reset the parameters manually every time"

				},
				"9": {
					"title": "Improved - Shader Maker auto PBR Path",
					"description": "Before this update Auto PBR (ShaderMaker) always opened the browser on the path of Blender's addons, and did not store the last path, I modified the operator that used ImportHelper, now it no longer uses this tool that limited the functionality, now the browser will always open in the last path used (In the current session of Blender)"

				"13": {
					"title": "Improved - Bake System",
					"description": "In accordance with some valuable feedback received, some functions already present in some versions ago have now been reintegrated, but now they have been improved to have greater control over the bake: **UV MAP SOURCE** Allows you to choose which UV mapping to use for the Bake, if the one already present on the object or a new UV Map. If a new UV Map is chosen, there will be 2 Properties available: **UV MARGIN** which allows you to adjust the margins of the uv mapping before the Bake. **MAKE SMART PROJECTION** allows you to perform an additional Smart projection that allows you to further set a UV mapping on the fly better if the default one does not give satisfactory results"
				},
				"14": {
					"title": "Improved - Paint Mask Autosave",
					"description": "It has been reported many times that after painting a material, when reopening Blender the painting disappeared, this is because it was not saved before exiting Blender (You need to activate 'Save Prompt' from Blender preferences), now this is no longer necessary as when you press 'Stop Paint', all changes are saved instantly, and there is no longer any need to save the changes to the image. I think this was necessary as many users encountered this problem. This makes the workflow more linear and error-proof"

					"title": "BugFix - Bake Mode Principled BSDF",
					"description": "It also happened that if you chose the Principled BSDF bake mode, and the materials did not contain a Principled BSDF node, the bake did not stop and an error was raised, this because the function used to check the existence of a Principled BSDF did not work well, now it has been fixed and if you try to bake in Principled BSDF mode when even just 1 material of the objects selected for the bake does not contain a Principled BSDF, the bake is blocked and a message is thrown to warn that it is not possible to bake in this mode, as the Principled BSDF is absent in the material node tree"
				},

					"title": "BugFix - Purge Unused Slots",
					"description": "If the selected objects were in Edit Mode, and the 'Purge Unused Slots' button was pressed, an error occurred, this because the code was not able to manage the objects in Edit Mode, now it has been corrected and it works correctly even in Edit Mode"

					"title": "Bug Fix - Painter",

				},
				"25": {
					"title": "BugFix - Documentation Right Click",
					"description": "The operator that takes you to the documentation with the Right click was based on a WM_MT_button_context class, this class went into conflict at the time of registration if other addons made use of this class, according to the Blender documentation, that method in addition was already obsolete, so we corrected the use using bpy.types.UI_MT_button_context_menu.append(). This method no longer conflicts with other addons and in addition keeps pace with Blender's APIs"

				},
				"27": {
					"title": "BugFix - Search and replace Module",
					"description": "It happened that on the Nexus modules if there were 2 or more modules, when a module of Material type Chess, or others from the procedural library was replaced, the 2 modules that had to be exchanged in position disconnected from the mixer, this was avoided by putting the function to link all the modules to the mixer at the end of the operator, in addition, the mixer was loaded incorrectly if the central modules were replaced when there were 3 or 4 modules present in the material, this because the number of modules present in the material was not counted, this was solved by counting the number of modules present in the mat.node_tree.nodes"

Now to overcome this, a Node (Fake Map) is created which simulates itself. In case of firing an RGB Socket, an RGB node is created and connected to Base Color, then rendered. If it were the cooking of a socket of type Value, a Node Value type is created, in order to make a Bake always connecting it to the Bsdf Base Color socket. This is essential if there are different materials on the same object, especially if they are materials without any links connected to the inputs of the BSDF node and you intend to bake them too."
