=============================
Installation (Older Version)
=============================

.. tip::
        To check which version of Extreme PBR you are using, and therefore be sure which guide to follow, you can check
        the version of the addon in 2 ways:
        - Via ``edit > preferences > addons`` and looking for the addon in the list by typing ``Extreme PBR`` in the search bar
        - If you have already installed the addon, you can access the preferences, by clicking on the button :ref:`mp_open_options`

        So the version is indicated in 2 places in the preferences window like this:

        .. image:: _static/_images/installation/see_version.webp
            :align: center
            :width: 600
            :alt: See version

.. important::
        The new version of Extreme PBR Nexus 4.1.100 has a new installation system described here :ref:`install_addon_41100`
        and here the installation of the libraries :ref:`install_library_41100` If you need to connect to our
        server to download the materials you can still do it, but you will have to activate the checkbox
        **I Have an Account on Extreme Addons** from the **Preferences** menu described here: :ref:`pr_op_i_have_an_account_on_extreme_addons`

.. _installation_step_1:

Step 1 (Addon Activation)
**************************

.. Attention::

            If you have already purchased the product on Blendermarket, or on Gumroad, you will only need to create a new account at https://extreme-addons.com/

            If you already have a registered account, you just need to be logged in on the website https://extreme-addons.com/

            .. image:: _static/_images/installation/login_singup_extreme_addons_01.jpg

                  :width: 700
                  :alt: Login / SingUp extreme addons



**Now, on step 1, let’s enter credentials to activate the addon**


- Mail/Password:
    - The email and password are those with which you registered on www.Extreme-Addons.com

- License:
    - To obtain the product license, check here how: https://docs.extreme-addons.com/manual/how-to-register-your-product-on-extreme-addons/
    - If you already have a license, you just need to access extreme-addons website, in this page there is your license,
      remember that you must be logged in with your credentials to see it: Your license page:
      https://extreme-addons.com/my-account/ea-license/

.. image:: _static/_images/installation/login_license_extreme_pbr.png
        :align: center
        :width: 800
        :alt: Login / License extreme pbr


.. Tip:: In case of problems, make sure you have not copied and pasted the license with “Whitespace” sometimes it happens that copy paste also copies whitespace.

.. Warning:: **Please note that the Mail and Password are the ones you used to login on Extreme-Addons website**


**Activate On This Computer**
You will have to press the “Activate on this computer” button, this also allows you to check if the credentials are correct.

**Move your license to this computer**
In case you want to move the license to another computer, you will have to press this button.
This takes you to your extreme-addons page to reset the license on your profile: https://extreme-addons.com/my-account/ea-license/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 (Choose Path)
**********************

Now click on the Choose the path button and select the folder where we want to install the Extreme PBR Library.

In this step, if (ONLY IF) you already had an Extreme PBR “User Library” / “User Lib” previously installed on your computer.
(If you had a previous version of Extreme PBR and saved your materials, you can indicate the path.

.. Note:: Remember, Extreme PBR libraries are very large, so to fully install the library, it will require almost 100 GiB
          of free space on the HardDisk you indicated. It is recommended that you install the libraries in a path that is not subject to path changes.

        :alt: Installation interface step 02


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step 3 (Get Material List)
***************************

This step is for obtaining the online material list. This gets a log of all files that can be downloaded.

        :align: center
        :width: 800
        :alt: Installation interface step 03


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 (Create Library Structure)
***********************************

We press the Create Library structure button to create all the information that the addon needs to run on your Hard Disk. This may take some time.

This button essentially creates a “Skeleton” library on your computer. From that skeleton library, materials can be downloaded online, at any time.
This process can take a few minutes.

        :alt: Installation interface step 04

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 (Install Material)
***************************

**In this Step, you can decide WHAT & IF you want to install**

Personally I suggest installing “ESSENTIAL” first, this downloads all the small packages needed to make the addon work. ESSENTIAL, download the files (Material Previews, Json, Texture 512×512 and all the procedural material)
Remember that many gigs are downloaded at the beginning. And that you can always download in high definition, just the materials you need from the appropriate panel, so you can save time.

.. image:: _static/_images/installation/installation_interface_step_05.jpg
        :align: center
        :width: 800
        :alt: Installation interface step 05


.. Note:: You can postpone this step for later as well. You can also install the materials individually, from the Extreme PBR panel.

            - **Essential (1GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install only necessary files + Texture at 512×512 px + All Procedural Materials
            - **1k Button (4GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install only the 1k Material (If essential files have not been installed, it will also install essential files)

            - **2k Button (14GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install only the 2k Material (If essential files have not been installed, it will also install essential files)

            - **4k Button (45 GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install only the 4k Material (If essential files have not been installed, it will also install essential files)

            - **8K button (124GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install the 8k Material + Any materials 5/6/7k (If essential files have not been installed, it will also install essential files)

            - **All (188GB +/-):**
                - Download and Install all the complete library –> (Essential/1k/2k/4k/8k)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Time Issues:
**************************

**Problems with VPN / Proxy:**
If you are using a VPN or Proxy and the download is slow, please Exclude extreme-addons.com from it, or temporarily disable the Proxy or VPN


**The installation times:**

It vary according to the internet speed and that of the computer in use, so during this step if you will install the libraries,
keep in mind that the download time is not a speed test, it would be wrong to think this, as during this process, they are also installed materials.
We did this in order to cancel the installation process, and pick up where you left off. So all downloaded materials will remain as such,
the installation process can be resumed at a later time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download single Material
-------------------------

This button is used to proceed with the installation of the single materials.
In the example the material selector is set to 8k, so you can choose whether to shoot only that dimension or all the others (1 / 2k, 2k, 4k)
If you have a similar situation, it means that you have not completed the complete installation process (And you can continue not to)
So if you are interested in installing the material, press “Install Single Material”

        :align: center
        :width: 300
        :alt: Download this material 01


**Once “Install single material” is pressed, a popup menu appears:**

        :align: center
        :width: 800
        :alt: Download this material popup panel


- Current Options:
    - Download only the material in the current version (8k In this example)

- Full Version:
    - Download all material version (in this case 1/2k, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k)

- Options ( Bottom right button ):
    - Open the “Install Material” menu (If you want to do the complete installation of the entire library, and not the single material.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress Bar(s)
---------------

Progress bars will be shown during the installation process.
You will be able to stop the installation when you want,
the material packs already downloaded are installed, so they will remain installed even when you cancel this process.
