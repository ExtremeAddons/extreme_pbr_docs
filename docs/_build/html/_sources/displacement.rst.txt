Displacement
==================

In order to access the displacement panel, you need to activate the displace from the Main Panel at the section :ref:`displace_on_off`.
Only then you will be able to see the displacement panel.

Make sure you have selected the material that has the active displacement from the :ref:`material_list` otherwise you will not
see the displacement panel.

.. note::
        Some materials, for example **Car Paint** or **Water** once applied you will not see the **Displacement** button.
        This is intended, as these materials do not need displacement. The button will be visible, only if in the
        material there is a Bump or Displacement map.
