Which version of Blender is compatible?
***************************************

The addon is compatible with all versions from 3.3 (Included) onwards.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Can I use the Materials for commercial projects?
*******************************************************

Yes, the entire Default library of Extreme PBR is provided under CC0 license, so you can use it even without citing the license.

In any case I have inserted in each Material the type of license of use. This can be viewed by pressing the Button
"Info" as in the image below, a popup opens, and from there you can see the type of license of use.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Are updates free?
***********************

Extreme PBR was born in 2019 and since then all users who have purchased the addon have received all updates for free.
This means that if you buy the addon today, you will have access to all future updates.

So, Yes!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I bought a version that is not PRO, can I upgrade to PRO in the future?
******************************************************************************

Yes, you can do it, you will just have to buy the PRO version and you will only pay the difference in price.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can I import my Textures into Extreme PBR?
***********************************************

Yes! but provided you import them on the fly, you can also save them in a "User Library" category and save the materials within it.
To do this, simply use the Shader Maker tool, you can find here: :ref:`auto_pbr` and here the video tutorial: :ref:`tutorial_shader_maker`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Do I need a powerful graphics card?
*****************************************

My advice is undoubtedly yes, but it is not mandatory. The important thing is to have a VRAM large enough, at least 4GB

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With which rendering engines can I use Extreme PBR ?
****************************************************

Cycles and Eevee are the rendering engines supported by Extreme PBR, support for other rendering engines is not planned at the moment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there support?
*****************

Of course! You can contact me on https://blendermarket.com/ or on my mails: **tredistudio@hotmail.com** or **info@extreme-addons.com**
