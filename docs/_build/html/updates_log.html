<h2>4.1.111<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 17-11-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Added - Anti Tile</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A new anti-tile function has been added for all materials based on textures, even for those imported with Shader Maker</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix - Asset Browser Creation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>An error occurred randomly, we think we fixed it by fixing the function that copied the context with bpy.context.copy(), now the context is no longer copied</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed - Asset Browser Creation Time (For Blender 4.x)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Speeded up the process of creating the asset browser in Blender 4, in this version of Blender, it was very slow, this has been fixed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed - Time to create the material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The time to create the material via the Add-New button has been speeded up by about x4 times, as the reloading of the textures was unnecessarily attempted in the function of assigning the textures in the image nodes, now an exception has been put that prevents the reloading as it was useless</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix - Auto Re-Link Libraries Button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Auto Re-Link button introduced in the previous version, if pressed without any .json files with the logs, this produced an error message, now instead a Popup message will be displayed that will warn that there are no libraries to be linked</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Asset Browser Size Choice</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a property to select which size to choose for the creation of the asset browser, now you can choose whether to create only assets from 1/2k, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k or All, that is all the available versions of the material (If installed) Procedural materials are always created, as they do not have a size expressed in pixels</p>

<h2>4.1.110<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 13-11-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Added: Works on Blender 4.0</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Extreme PBR now works on Blender 4.0 and also on previous versions from 3.3 onwards</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Add material 2x faster for Nexus Texture Materials</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A new smart system makes the creation of Materials (So the addition) much faster, as Eevee takes much less time to compile the shader, this was possible by managing the unused internal nodes and putting them on mute if they are not used</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed: Subsurface Color</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In accordance with the new Blender 4.0 which has removed the Subsurface Color socket in Blender 4.0 now the Subsurface Color will be guided by Base Color</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improve: Rotation XYZ</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For some reason, the Nexus node had its XYZ Rotation properties set to Float and not Angle, now these properties will be in degrees as they already should be.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Normal Map Space Type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added in the panel the possibility to choose the type of space for the normal map, this was necessary so as not to have to open the node tree and manually modify the normal map node, based on all the normal map nodes, the Space properties of each of them will be displayed, by default Extreme PBR has only 2 at most, the classic, and the one for the clearcoat (If present)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix: Clearcoat Bump Map</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Clearcoat Bump Map node was not created correctly, in its place a Normal Map node was created, this was not right. Now it has been fixed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improve: Mapping Type and Coordinate</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the Coordinate system relied on the options of the material or those of the group node, now the coordinate system is no longer managed by the mapping menu, but directly under the Material Editor, it works as before, with the difference that you can choose the coordinate system of the material and the type of Projection on the texture nodes, directly in the Material editor. This to avoid confusion, as each Extreme PBR Module can now have its own different coordinate system, which was not possible before, as it was managed by a single material property</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fix: Paint Mode</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The paint mode could start in ‚ÄòGradient‚Äô mode instead of ‚ÄòColor‚Äô this could be confusing as the paint could not work, now the brush will default to Color</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improve: Normal Map Space</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now from the ‚ÄòMaterial Editor‚Äô panel it is possible to modify the Space Type of the Normal Map type nodes</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moved: UV Mapping Type (Mapping Editor)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In accordance with the previous changes, now the UV Mapping Type property will no longer be present in the Mapping Editor panel, but will be present in the material panels, at the bottom. In these panels: Material Editor, Shader Overlay, Material Override</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Interface</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The main box in the Material Editor, Shader Overlay, Material Override panels has been removed to give more space to the panel, in fact the global Box tended to reduce the space of the panel, now it has been removed, and the panel is slightly more spacious in width</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Material Editor Panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Material Editor panel disappeared if you did not select an Object with an active material, this was to avoid confusion, but the interface update was not very responsive, so it may be necessary to click 2 times on the object to update the interface. Now the Material Editor panel will always be shown, with a warning message if the object or material does not exist.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed: Individual Vectors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The individual vectors have been removed, now they are no longer present in the Texture Manager Panel, this is for Shader Calculation savings</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Purge Unused</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The function that eliminated Material - Group Nodes - Images It has been improved, when you delete a material, all these objects are deleted if they were present in the Blender data but no longer used. Before it happened in a much less precise way, now it should be much more precise</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix: Hide Microdisplacement</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you press the button to hide the displacement and you are in microdisplacement mode, only the subdivision modifiers were deactivated and the Displacement node was not muted, now it has been fixed, the Displacement node is muted</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Auto Link to Asset</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On Blender startup, if Extreme PBR has been installed, if the libraries are linked, it is checked if the asset_browser library exists in these libraries, if so, the library is added to the list of asset_browser libraries in Blender. To deactivate, set the ‚ÄòAuto link asset‚Äô function to False from the addon options</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Asset Browser Creation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The modal operator that creates the Asset Browser libraries has been improved to avoid as many anomalous crashes as possible</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Reuse images</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The texture image loading script analyzed whether the image was already present in the project and checked whether the image had the data via image.has_data, this could happen if the image did not have has_data an error was raised in the texture loading. The script has been improved and if there is no has_data, the image is now reloaded correctly</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed: Subsurface Bake</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Since Blender 4.0 no longer has the ‚ÄòSubsurface‚Äô (Color) input in the inputs of the Principled BSDF node, I decided to remove the Subsurface Bake function, as it is no longer necessary</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Download This Material Button Continues to Appear</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you had installed the libraries via server and some materials had not been downloaded, under the material preview the button ‚ÄòDownload This material‚Äô appeared even after installing all the materials via Exapack, now the button no longer appears, unless you activate the option ‚ÄòI have an account on Extreme Addons‚Äô, in this case it will be present again</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Nexus Mixer (Only on Blender 4.0 or higher)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The new Nexus 4.0 system (Only on Blender 4.0) no longer needs the Mixer when 1 Nexus Module is present, this saves resources and connects the module or Fx directly to the Principled BSDF</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Nexus Use Socket (Only from Blender 4.0 or higher)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now the sockets are connected in a smarter way, they have been divided into categories: ‚ÄòSUBSURFACE‚Äô, ‚ÄòANISOTROPIC‚Äô, ‚ÄòCOAT‚Äô, ‚ÄòSHEEN‚Äô, ‚ÄòEMISSION‚Äô, ‚ÄòTRANSMISSION‚Äô, this allows you to choose whether to show the inputs of the nexus module, and consequently disconnect or connect the links to the Principled BSDF, this allows you to save resources and space in the panel, if for example you are not using the Coat (Ex Clearcoat), the sockets are automatically set at the time of creation of the material, but can be managed by the drop-down menu present in the bar to the right of the Module Material Panel</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Popup Utility Panel Replaced</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In order to make the interface more comfortable, I am replacing the old popup panels with popover panels, so the old popup panel that disappeared as soon as a button inside it was pressed, has been replaced with a popover panel</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patch: No Transmission for Ice Materials</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>By applying the materials of the Ice category, the Transmission was not set as it was not present in the mat_info.json file, now all the Ice materials are corrected with the Transmission set to 1.0</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Add Material problem with exapack versions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It happens that if the addon library has been downloaded from the extreme-addons site, and then the exapack are installed, the files not completely downloaded from Extreme-Addons are not updated, and an exa_files.json file remains, if this happened, once the button was pressed to add the material, an error appeared: ‚ÄòAttention, this material version has yet to be downloaded from extreme-addons, to download this material version‚Ä¶ etc.‚Äô now an additional case has been added in which if the material files are already present, this message is skipped and the material can be added again</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Shader Overlay disappears</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If there was an overlay shader on the material and a Module was added for painting or an Fx, the node containing the overlay shader disappeared, now it no longer happens and remains inside the material</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Error when bake with a Shader Overlay</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you tried to Bake in ‚ÄòBsdf‚Äô mode and the Shader Overlay was present, an error was raised because the BSDF node was not directly connected to the material output node, this was omitted, in any case the ‚ÄòBsdf‚Äô bake with the shader overlay applied is no longer allowed, and a popup will be shown that warns that the Bake with shader overlay applied can only be done in ‚ÄòCycles Standard‚Äô and ‚ÄòCombined‚Äô mode</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Switch from modules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you tried to change the nexus module (Replacement between modules Search Module button) this once replaced did not respect the inputs values of the previous position, I proceeded to update and correct the operator which now stores the default_value values and replaces them, maintaining the logic</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Draw Material Editor Speed</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The time to draw the entire Material Editor panel has been improved, now it is about x2 times faster than before</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moved: Displacement Panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The ‚ÄòDisplacement‚Äô panel has been moved to the ‚ÄòBox Utility‚Äô bar, now it is in the form of a Popover, to be more comfortable and close to the displacement activation button (The button will be visible only if the displacement is active)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix: Add Module o Replace in Simple PBR material_type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It happened that if you added a material in Nexus Mode, and then switched to Simple PBR mode, Trying to Add a Nexus Module or trying to replace it, an error was raised, as the addon tried to add a Simple PBR instead of a Nexus module. This was corrected with a condition for which the mode is changed to Nexus and the Simple PBR mode is restored at the end of execution</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Add Material With Numeric Suffix</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It happened that when adding some materials from the library if they were saved with a suffix for example .001 .002 .003 now at the time of import the renaming of it is attempted without a numeric suffix (Only if a material with that name is not already present in the project)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fix: Simple PBR Specular</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In most cases when the material with Simple PBR setting was applied, the Specular remained set to 0.5 if the specular map did not exist, now it is set to 0.1 by default</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fix: Re-Project Problem</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you add a Module for painting, an UV layer is automatically created, but it was not projected with the smart projection, the painting worked correctly but when you pressed ‚ÄòRe-Prokect‚Äô the UV map was projected for the first time damaging the mapping of the current painting even if right, now this is solved by an initial projection equal to that which is carried out using the ‚ÄòRe-Project‚Äô button so as not to confuse. Note: The ‚ÄòRe-Project‚Äô button was created to re-project the UV mapping in case you modify the object in use, this does a correct projection, but breaks the painting (Expected behavior) use with caution!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Anti: Crash improved</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The function that preserves from the crash has been improved, as it was annoying because if you were on the Cycles render engine in Preview or Solid mode, the function set Eevee, now it sets it and brings it back to the previous render engine without changing the mode to the user, this function preserves from crashes and anomalous errors that have been present for some years in Blender, the anti-crash is active by default</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Auto Re-Link Libraries Button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In order not to have to restart Blender once the addon has been updated, if Extreme PBR 4.x.x was already in use previously, a button appears in the context of the library menus, this once pressed will try to reconnect the addon to the previous paths to the libraries, this to avoid the annoyance of having to restart Blender because the function was and is still executed when Blender is started or a new project is loaded</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p><strong>Release date: 04-09-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Improve: Paint Mask Between 4 Nexus Materials</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The painting mask for Nexus modules, is now much more precise, the RGB channels have been replaced by painting with the values R: (1, 0, 0) G: (1, 2, 0) B: (1,0,1) this eliminates that annoying halo of material n 4 if you are painting between 4 different material modules. Now the painting mask is much more precise. I thank the user who reported the problem, it was really useful and was solved 24 hours after the report</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fix: Paint mode problem when you press Fill</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Pressing the FILL button when you are in Texture Paint, resuming the painting could cause the brush not to work. Now for safety, when you press FILL, the Texture Paint stops</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fix: Search-Replace-Add Data material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When using one of these two buttons to add or replace the data material to the object, to the added or replaced material the nodes sockets were hidden, this happened to all materials not created with Extreme PBR and was annoying, now this happens only to the Nexus type nodes, and only in the node_tree of the material not to that of the group nodes</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improve: Make user lib Data folder</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The user library identification system has been improved from the previous version, now the USER library is automatically added to the ._data folder, while in version 4.1.100 it had to be done manually</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Color Ramp Widget in the interface</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If a Color Ramp node is present in the Nexus material useful for editing the material, it can now be shown in the material editor and in general in all areas of the interface that are drawn by the appropriate function</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Material Random Location</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a button to randomly change the location of the material in the material editor, useful especially on fences or objects that need a variation in the position of the material as they are very close together, Available in all Nexus type materials</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Paint Preview Material slot disable Render</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the paint Mode if the Extreme PBR material slot was displayed, with each brush stroke, the material slot was updated, this slowed down the paint mode because of the render that had to be done on the material preview. Now during the paint Mode the material preview is replaced by a MATERIAL icon so that the paint is much less slow. This was done to speed up the paint mode. Pay attention to the Blender Material Slot, if opened the problem will persist, it is advisable to close any interface that shows the material slot, this will slow things down a lot if you are using the paint mode.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix: Microdisplacement with multiple modules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When a Microdisplacement was added to the material, and then a module was added for the texture paint, the Displacement node was disconnected. It was fixed by updating the function that connects the sockets from the mixer to the other nodes</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>4.1.100<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 20-08-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Added: Space Colors Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Many users have rightly reported that Extreme PBR materials only worked in the sRGB and Non-Color color space, now from the options menu it is possible to change the default color spaces of the project</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes: BW Map Colorspace for Nexus materials</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The color space in the Modules and Fx of the Nexus materials, before was managed in sRGB even the BW maps, then they were converted into a color space ‚ÄòNon-Color‚Äô Through a Gamma node. Now given the change and the support of more colors, the Gamma node would no longer convert correctly, if not using sRGB, so it was chosen to change the color space directly in the texture node, the ‚ÄòNon-Color‚Äô button in texture manager now it will no longer be present in new projects.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix: Download Materials Stuck</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a condition on os.remove(‚Äòexa_files.json‚Äô) this generated an error that blocked the download of materials, in some cases.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Displacement Menu</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A separate menu for displacement has been added and replaced the previous one, it is displayed only when an object is selected, and contains a displacement activated by Extreme PBR, this was done because some people had trouble finding the displacement menu under the properties of the material editor menu.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Toggle Wireframe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a button in the Displacement menu, so that you can quickly view the wireframe of the selected object</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Library Path Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The library management system now also stores that of the expansions, if an expansion is added it is also stored inside a .json file, so that if you change the version of Blender and if you install Extreme PBR again at the first start it will recognize the library paths and set them automatically. This was done so as not to have to indicate the paths every time you reinstall Extreme PBR (The json file will be saved inside the folder above that of the addons and is named ExtremeAddons)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Regeneration of Preview Icons</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The button to regenerate the preview of the material icons (Under the preview material), now also regenerates the icons damaged by the Beta-Alpha versions of Blender, so they are regenerated simply by copying and deleting the damaged icons and reloading the material preview.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Total regeneration of all icons</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Always for the reason in the previous point (Damaged Previews) The <em>Patch previews</em> button now becomes <em>Regenerate Previews and Icons</em> so it will regenerate all the material icons and also those of the interface. The Beta and Alpha versions of Blender 3.6 had also damaged the icons. This allows you to regenerate and reload them</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: New interface</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The interface has been divided into several UI panels so that they can be reordered and closed at will</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Right Click Online Documentation Button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On every Extreme PBR button or property, by right clicking, you can choose to open the online documentation, so you can read the explanation of each function. Note: At the moment the properties of the material sliders do not work, because they refer to the official Blender documentation</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix: Bake Dynamic Mask GPU</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It often happened that during the Make Dynamic Mask, the Bake lasted too long, this is because the Bake was sometimes set to CPU, now it is set to GPU by default, so it should work correctly and be faster</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix: Add Fx Layer, wrong map</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When adding an Fx layer, for an error, in most cases a diffuse texture was chosen, now the function that chooses the correct texture has been reversed, and it should choose the correct texture because the necessary mask should be in black and white, and only if it does not exist, in extreme cases choose the diffuse</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: New Docs right click button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In almost all the buttons and properties of Extreme PBR, a function has been added where by right clicking with the mouse, a button will be shown (Extreme PBR Online Manual) which will lead to the explanation of that button or property</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: New Documentation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The new documentation is much more complete than the previous one, in addition it is much faster, now we use a new site for the documentation which is much faster, in addition we use a Readthedocs theme just like that of Blender</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dismissing: Support for Blender less than 3.3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Due to the new Blender nodes, we cannot continue to offer support for versions less than Blender 3.3, the nodes present in Extreme PBR, may no longer work correctly on versions less than Blender 3.2, so now you will have to have at least a version of Blender 3.3 or higher (Better if higher)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch: Stuck during the material download phase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the download phase an error was raised during the execution of os.remove() of the file ‚Äòexa_files.json‚Äô this blocked the dowload. Now an exception in case ‚Äòexa_files.json‚Äô does not exist, no longer raises errors as it is checked with os.path.isfile ()</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch: Previews Disappear into Blender 3.6 alpha</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Using Blender 3.6 Alpha, for some reason it damages the preview images of the materials, once damaged, not even using another version of Blender will be displayed correctly. I added a button in Options (Patch Preview) that should solve the problem by regenerating the previews that are no longer displayed</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix: They don‚Äôt show the properties</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With the advent of Blender 3.4 the RGB Mix node has changed, so also some functions that referred to it, no longer worked. I added a check that understands if the node is MixRGB or Mix, as the number of inputs in the Mix node has increased, and this made it unrecognizable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch: Black Material (Combine/Separate RGB)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With the new Blender 3.3 the Separate/Combine RGB node has changed, so if you open the project in Blender 3.3 or higher and save the project to then return to a previous version, the Combine/Separate RGB node is no longer recognized. I made a second patch to better solve this problem</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patch: For Black Material Mix RGB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The previous patch, now in Blender 3.4 creates confusion, as the Mix RGB node, is now also changed. This patch should solve the problem of Black materials with a Mix RGB not recognized, or a Mix node (New) changed by the previous patch.</p>

<li><p><strong>Patch: Black Material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Opening old projects in Blender 3_3 version the Separate RGB and Combine RGB node were not recognized. So a small feature was created that arranges the black materials. The button will be located in Extreme PBRs Options, and is called Adjust All material Node Tree.

<li><p><strong>BuxFix: RGBA Error During the Bake</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the Bake, if the scene was set to a movie (Like MP4) or an image that did not allow the Alpha channel, you would get an error like this: Cannot set RGBA in color_mode, the script stopped, it was necessary to set an image also PNG to avoid the error. Now this has been fixed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added: Shader Overlay (Experimental)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This new feature allows you to apply a material to all selected objects, plus there is also a Gradient mixer to adjust the mix position of the material in the Overlay. Useful for presentations with Blueprinting or the overlay of material with special effect</p>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p><strong>Change: Normal and Bump Node</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now the Normal and Bump Node are no longer in a group node. This is to eventually save resources. The nodes are interactive and are connected only if really needed</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading support added.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Installer And Server Api</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With this version the installation of the materials happens faster, due to the API change of our server. Now the calls are much less, and we have a cleaner data flow. Older versions will still work on the site‚Äôs old APIs, but it is recommended that you update the addon</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Material Installer Multithreading</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading was added for library download. now you can continue to use Blender, without having to open another Blender to continue working while downloading materials</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: First Installation Interface</strong></p>

<div><p>The first install interface has been improved to make it less confusing. Now the steps are drawn separately with Back-Next buttons to easily continue the installation without too much confusion as in the previous version.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Force reload Preview Material Icons</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have found that in Blender 3.2 some times the material preview icons are not loading correctly. I inserted a button to force reload the preview of the icons. It is now located in the Box, Tag and material options Panel, just below the Material Preview.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>When trying to add a grease pencil material (From project material list) an error was shown. Has been solved.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix: ColorSpace Error, with ACES OCIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is not really a good FIX, but there is a warning message, if the user uses ACES expansions, it is reported that it is not possible to set the sRGB or Non-Color color space correctly, for now it is a sort of Patch , we are studying a better fix for this situation. For now, the error will be avoided and consequently the interruption of the Extreme PBR operators will be avoided</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix: Painter Problem with erase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>While painting, the Strength Slider did not work in the texture manager, making it impossible to adjust the Black and White (Strength) of the paint, which also made it impossible to erase the paint just made.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix And Improved - BSDF Bake Type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There was a problem with BSDF bake mode, if for example no node was connected to the BSDF input to bake, (for example Base Color), the result was completely wrong. Now to overcome this, a Node (Fake Map) is created which simulates itself. In case of firing an RGB Socket, an RGB node is created and connected to Base Color, then rendered. If it were the cooking of a socket of type Value, a Node Value type is created, in order to make a Bake always connecting it to the Bsdf Base Color socket. This is essential if there are different materials on the same object, especially if they are materials without any links connected to the inputs of the BSDF node and you intend to bake them too.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Bake Flip X Axis</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Improvement for bake with Export FBX, especially for Unreal Engine, as the Unreal Engine‚Äôs Global axes are different from those of Blender, If you check the Flip X Axis checkbox before doing the Bake (Activating Export FBX Object) , it will be possible to try to flip the X axes, in order to have the object as it is in Unreal. This setting is currently experimental, so it needs user feedback. If you are having trouble, uncheck this box</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix: No Preview in data image list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>No Preview for the images in the list in the generation of normal maps and into search data images (Ops). We fixed it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: Re-projection button on Fx Layer Menu</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a Re-project button on Fx Layer Menu. This button was only present in the inter-module painting.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved: FAQs Button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A FAQs button has been added in some parts of the addon. It will also be accessible by pressing the Helps button in the Main interface</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed: ShaderMaker Paint Error</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Error when trying to add a Shadermaker Paint to a Curve object</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added-Fixed: Create New UV Map added into Bake editor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After a few Bake reports, we have found a solution to Bake so that if the object does not have a correct UV mapping, you can choose to Create a new UV map. It will be projected with the Blender Pack Islands system. While previously a Smart Projection method was used, which did not meet the need, we had provisionally removed it, but many inexperienced users were expecting immediate Bake without having to change the UV mapping (Rightly so). We think this is my best method for now. Looking forward to new features</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed: Error when UV Maps are 8-slot</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Blender has a limit of 8 UV Layers, so we had an Error when some Operators gave Error if the UV Layers were 8. An additional check has been added, and a message will be shown if this happens</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Bake improvement</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The bake has been improved. Now you can do 3 different types of Bake. It is now also possible to bake non-Extreme PBR materials. The three types are 1 - Bake Based on BSDF Principled Materials. 2: Classic Bake by Cycles. 3 - Classic Bake Combined by Cycles. Everything is ready to bake in just a few steps. In addition Previously in Bake we used a Smart Projection, but it was not a good idea, now we use the PackIsland method, this greatly improves the output uv mapping.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Texture Browser Added</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the material shader editor you can now access the new Texture Browser menu. All textures present in Extreme PBR can now be searched through this menu, and added directly to a Texture Image node in the node tree</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Panel Builder Helper</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Panel Builder Helper has now been improved. It turns out cleaner and less confusing. A Socket slot viewer has also been added.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Simple PBR material options Added</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now it is possible to create simple PBR materials, without Nexus node tree, so as to create a Base node tree, which you can modify at will. PLEASE NOTE: it is not possible to paint over it for the moment or add a fx layer. if you want to do this you have to use Nexus materials!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Painter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now the default Painter shows all the maps turned off (Mute), except the diffuse one. This is to avoid problems on the Macintosh Users, as Macintosh does not currently support many textures on the same material</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provisional Patch: Texture Limiter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Due to limitations on Mac systems, as it is known that there is a maximum number of textures on a single material, and it is very limited. A function has been added that recognizes if the computer is a Mac System. So it automatically limits the use of textures on materials, so you can mix more of them. This is a momentary patch pending Vulkan on Blender API, hopefully they will be added as soon as possible, this is a limitation for Macintosh users.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Old Extreme PBR (Combo-Evo) panel properties</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now, in the panel it is possible to return to view the sliders of the old Extreme PBR (Combo-Evo) materials, it is not identical to before, but it is quite similar.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement: Slider On the Extreme PBR panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you are using a material based on a Principled BSDF node connected directly to the output, you can now view the sliders in the Extreme PBR panel. If the inputs of the Principled BSDF are connected, the sliders of the node from which they are connected will also be shown (Both Normal Node and Group node)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>bug fix- Add Material From User Library</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>An error occurs when the material is applied, this did not compromise the correct functioning, but it was very annoying. Fixed</p>

<li><p><strong>Fixed: Bake with Smart Projection</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We noticed that Bake remained with a smart projection, while programming Extreme PBR we had escaped to disable Smart Projection during Bake, this did Bake objects with a new smart mapping.

<blockquote>
<div><p>We have added a button (Adjust All Material node Tree) in the Options menu. This fixes all possible broken Materials, or possibly for a passage of a project created with Blender 2.83 to Blender 2.93+ due to the fact that the nodes are slightly different due to the missing Emission Strength socket.
