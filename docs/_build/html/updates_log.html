<h2>4.0.207<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 05-07-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch - Stuck during the material download phase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the download phase an error was raised during the execution of os.remove() of the file ‚Äòexa_files.json‚Äô this blocked the dowload. Now an exception in case ‚Äòexa_files.json‚Äô does not exist, no longer raises errors as it is checked with os.path.isfile ()</p>

<h2>4.0.206<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 10-05-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch - Previews Disappear into Blender 3.6 alpha</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Using Blender 3.6 Alpha, for some reason it damages the preview images of the materials, once damaged, not even using another version of Blender will be displayed correctly. I added a button in Options (Patch Preview) that should solve the problem by regenerating the previews that are no longer displayed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="id3">
<h2>4.0.205<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 30-12-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix - They don‚Äôt show the properties</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With the advent of Blender 3.4 the RGB Mix node has changed, so also some functions that referred to it, no longer worked. I added a check that understands if the node is MixRGB or Mix, as the number of inputs in the Mix node has increased, and this made it unrecognizable.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>4.0.204<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 26-12-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch For Black Material (Combine/Separate RGB)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With the new Blender 3.3 the Separate/Combine RGB node has changed, so if you open the project in Blender 3.3 or higher and save the project to then return to a previous version, the Combine/Separate RGB node is no longer recognized. I made a second patch to better solve this problem</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patch - For Black Material Mix RGB</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The previous patch, now in Blender 3.4 creates confusion, as the Mix RGB node, is now also changed. This patch should solve the problem of Black materials with a Mix RGB not recognized, or a Mix node (New) changed by the previous patch.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Reload Mixers Nodes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a button (Into Options) to reload the Mixers nodes, in case of problems with the Mixers nodes, or if you want to reload the Mixers nodes, without in only one click.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Error in copying scene attributes on some occasions. For now it has been solved using the try-except method.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patch - Black Material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Opening old projects in Blender 3_3 version the Separate RGB and Combine RGB node were not recognized. So a small feature was created that arranges the black materials. The button will be located in Extreme PBRs Options, and is called Adjust All material Node Tree. It was already present in previous versions, but a new function has been added in addition to the other previous ones.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>4.0.202<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 19-07-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - Mirco-displacement Not Work</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>An oversight was left behind. The function to update the displacement (On Off) of the microdisplacement, had not been replaced with the new one. I proceeded to insert the new function, as the system of nodes (Normal, Bump, Displacement) has changed slightly in this version.</p>

<h2>4.0.201<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>

</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix - Save Material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On some occasions, during the Save Material, an error could occur, this error was in case the material contained a Packed image from another file, then the unpack method (method = USE_ORIGINAL) function, did not work. I put an exception with the unpack method (method = USE_LOCAL) This solved the problem</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>4.0.200<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 19-07-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - RGBA Error During the Bake</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the Bake, if the scene was set to a movie (Like MP4) or an image that did not allow the Alpha channel, you would get an error like this: Cannot set RGBA in color_mode, the script stopped, it was necessary to set an image also PNG to avoid the error. Now this has been fixed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Shader Overlay (Experimental)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This new feature allows you to apply a material to all selected objects, plus there is also a Gradient mixer to adjust the mix position of the material in the Overlay. Useful for presentations with Blueprinting or the overlay of material with special effect</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Change - Normal and Bump Node</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now the Normal and Bump Node are no longer in a group node. This is to eventually save resources. The nodes are interactive and are connected only if really needed</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Get Library Register</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading support added, now the interface no longer freezes when using the ‚ÄòGet The Register‚Äô button</p>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p><strong>Improved - Create Library Structure</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading support added.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p><strong>Fixed - Create Library Structure</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading support added.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Installer And Server Api</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With this version the installation of the materials happens faster, due to the API change of our server. Now the calls are much less, and we have a cleaner data flow. Older versions will still work on the site‚Äôs old APIs, but it is recommended that you update the addon</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Material Installer Multithreading</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Multithreading was added for library download. now you can continue to use Blender, without having to open another Blender to continue working while downloading materials</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - First Installation Interface</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The first install interface has been improved to make it less confusing. Now the steps are drawn separately with Back-Next buttons to easily continue the installation without too much confusion as in the previous version.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Force reload Preview Material Icons</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have found that in Blender 3.2 some times the material preview icons are not loading correctly. I inserted a button to force reload the preview of the icons. It is now located in the Box, Tag and material options Panel, just below the Material Preview.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BugFix for Blender 3.2 - Material Previews form Search material list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The icons of the materials listed in the Search Material were no longer loaded correctly in Blender 3.2. They will now load correctly.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Material Override (Experimental)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Material Override, overrides for a view on the fly, all the materials of the selected objects. It makes use of the Geometry Nodes System. It is very quick to change material, unlike Shader Overlay. The phase is still experimental, they await feedback from users</p>

<h2>4.0.131<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 10-04-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - Search material Grease Pencil Error</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When trying to add a grease pencil material (From project material list) an error was shown. Has been solved.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - ColorSpace Error, with ACES OCIO</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is not really a good FIX, but there is a warning message, if the user uses ACES expansions, it is reported that it is not possible to set the sRGB or Non-Color color space correctly, for now it is a sort of Patch , we are studying a better fix for this situation. For now, the error will be avoided and consequently the interruption of the Extreme PBR operators will be avoided</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - Painter Problem with erase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>While painting, the Strength Slider did not work in the texture manager, making it impossible to adjust the Black and White (Strength) of the paint, which also made it impossible to erase the paint just made.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix And Improved - BSDF Bake Type</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There was a problem with BSDF bake mode, if for example no node was connected to the BSDF input to bake, (for example Base Color), the result was completely wrong. Now to overcome this, a Node (Fake Map) is created which simulates itself. In case of firing an RGB Socket, an RGB node is created and connected to Base Color, then rendered. If it were the cooking of a socket of type Value, a Node Value type is created, in order to make a Bake always connecting it to the Bsdf Base Color socket. This is essential if there are different materials on the same object, especially if they are materials without any links connected to the inputs of the BSDF node and you intend to bake them too.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Bake Flip X Axis</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Improvement for bake with Export FBX, especially for Unreal Engine, as the Unreal Engine‚Äôs Global axes are different from those of Blender, If you check the Flip X Axis checkbox before doing the Bake (Activating Export FBX Object) , it will be possible to try to flip the X axes, in order to have the object as it is in Unreal. This setting is currently experimental, so it needs user feedback. If you are having trouble, uncheck this box</p>

<h2>4.0.130<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 09-03-2022 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BuxFix - No Preview in data image list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>No Preview for the images in the list in the generation of normal maps and into search data images (Ops). We fixed it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - Re-projection button on Fx Layer Menu</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a Re-project button on Fx Layer Menu. This button was only present in the inter-module painting.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved - FAQs Button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A FAQs button has been added in some parts of the addon. It will also be accessible by pressing the Helps button in the Main interface</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed - ShaderMaker Paint Error</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Error when trying to add a Shadermaker Paint to a Curve object</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added-Fixed - Create New UV Map added into Bake editor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After a few Bake reports, we have found a solution to Bake so that if the object does not have a correct UV mapping, you can choose to Create a new UV map. It will be projected with the Blender Pack Islands system. While previously a Smart Projection method was used, which did not meet the need, we had provisionally removed it, but many inexperienced users were expecting immediate Bake without having to change the UV mapping (Rightly so). We think this is my best method for now. Looking forward to new features</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed - Error when UV Maps are 8-slot</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Blender has a limit of 8 UV Layers, so we had an Error when some Operators gave Error if the UV Layers were 8. An additional check has been added, and a message will be shown if this happens</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Bake improvement</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The bake has been improved. Now you can do 3 different types of Bake. It is now also possible to bake non-Extreme PBR materials. The three types are 1 - Bake Based on BSDF Principled Materials. 2 - Classic Bake by Cycles. 3 - Classic Bake Combined by Cycles. Everything is ready to bake in just a few steps. In addition Previously in Bake we used a Smart Projection, but it was not a good idea, now we use the PackIsland method, this greatly improves the output uv mapping.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Texture Browser Added</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the material shader editor you can now access the new Texture Browser menu. All textures present in Extreme PBR can now be searched through this menu, and added directly to a Texture Image node in the node tree</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Panel Builder Helper</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Panel Builder Helper has now been improved. It turns out cleaner and less confusing. A Socket slot viewer has also been added.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Simple PBR material options Added</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now it is possible to create simple PBR materials, without Nexus node tree, so as to create a Base node tree, which you can modify at will. PLEASE NOTE: it is not possible to paint over it for the moment or add a fx layer. if you want to do this you have to use Nexus materials!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Painter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now the default Painter shows all the maps turned off (Mute), except the diffuse one. This is to avoid problems on the Macintosh Users, as Macintosh does not currently support many textures on the same material</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provisional Patch- Texture Limiter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Due to limitations on Mac systems, as it is known that there is a maximum number of textures on a single material, and it is very limited. A function has been added that recognizes if the computer is a Mac System. So it automatically limits the use of textures on materials, so you can mix more of them. This is a momentary patch pending Vulkan on Blender API, hopefully they will be added as soon as possible, this is a limitation for Macintosh users.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Old Extreme PBR (Combo-Evo) panel properties</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now, in the panel it is possible to return to view the sliders of the old Extreme PBR (Combo-Evo) materials, it is not identical to before, but it is quite similar.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>improvement - Slider On the Extreme PBR panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you are using a material based on a Principled BSDF node connected directly to the output, you can now view the sliders in the Extreme PBR panel. If the inputs of the Principled BSDF are connected, the sliders of the node from which they are connected will also be shown (Both Normal Node and Group node)</p>
